# Chatbot-Error404
SO here we are for the coding challenge and i am looking for a problem that is very crucial in these days.
DIAGNOSE OF A DISEASES BY PREDICTING IT FROM SYMPTOMS.
This is an attempt to predict diseases from the given symptoms. 
As we are going to develop a hybrid application in which we are providing a chatbot and dataset which read the information and provide the user the estimated or predicted disease. 
This dataset is uncleaned so preprocessing is done and then model is trained and tested on it.
We will further develop a database where the application try to learn new data and try to predict and process over it.
Goals of our project:
These days people are suffering from lot of diseases and sometimes they are not able to reach doctor.
So, our first goal is to make doctorate help available through chatbot whenever needed.
People from any area of world will be able to use it and can have regular evaluations of their health.
Output of this project will be to analyze according to its symptoms, a person is having what kind of health issues/diseases.
According to the person's health, it will tell if the person have to attend doctor or not
