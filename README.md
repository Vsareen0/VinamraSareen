## Diagnosing diseases by predicting it from symptoms.
This is an attempt to predict diseases from the given symptoms. 

We have planned to work on a chatbot that will provide users information about diseases and its cure based on symptoms. We have proposed to implement a hybrid app for the same.    

## Goals of our project:

- First step is to create a dataset that contains symptoms and diseases.
- The next step, is to provide relevant answers based on users queries. For this we will be using diagflow, a humanâ€“computer interaction technologies based on natural language conversations.   
- People from any area of world will be able to use it [multilingual].
